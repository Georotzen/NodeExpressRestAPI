## Node.JS and Express.JS - REST API

Technologies needed for Web Design and Development:

> ####	Node.JS - Node.js is a single-threaded, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for building fast and scalable server-side and networking applications. It runs on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, and it uses event-driven, non-blocking I/O architecture, which makes it efficient and suitable for real-time applications. About | Node.js (nodejs.org)

> ####	Express.JS - Express is a node.js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application. Reference: Express JS Tutorial: What is Express in Node JS? (simplilearn.com) 

> ####	React.js - React.js, commonly referred simply as React, is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. Every React web application is composed of reusable components which make up parts of the user interface. React is also a single-page application [SPA]. So instead of sending a request to the server every time a new page is to be rendered, the contents of the page are loaded directly from React components. This leads to faster rendering without page reloads. 

> ####	Mapillary.JS - Mapillary.JS is a client-side JavaScript library for interactive, extendable street imagery map experiences on the web. It takes spatial, semantic, and texture data and renders it using WebGL. Mapillary.JS can be customized with camera controls, user interactivity, and data providers and it can be augmented with geospatial rendering, animation, and content placement.
